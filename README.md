# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on key health metrics using a machine-learning model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📜 Project Description
The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to train and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The key features include:
- Data preprocessing with standardization.
- Machine learning model training and evaluation.
- Accuracy assessment on training and testing datasets.
- Example predictions using test inputs.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Pima Indians Diabetes Database (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
- **Attributes**:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  - Age
  - Outcome (Target variable)

## 🛡️ Features
-**Data Preprocessing**:
- Handled missing values in key features like Glucose and BMI.
- Standardized features using StandardScaler.
- Model: Trained an SVM classifier with a linear kernel.
- Evaluation:
- Training accuracy: 78.7%.
